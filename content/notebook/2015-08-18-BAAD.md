Together with 92 other co-authors, we recently published the [Biomass And
Allometry Database (BAAD)](https://github.com/dfalster/baad) as a [data
paper](https://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E096/128/) in the journal Ecology,
combining data from 176 different scientific studies into a single unified
database.

We built BAAD for several reasons: 

1. we needed it for our own work
2. we perceived a strong need within the vegetation modelling community for such a database, and 
3. because it allowed us to road-test some new methods for building and maintaining a database.
