Here is a talk I presented at the workshop "[Trait-based approaches to Ocean Life"](http://trait-based-workshop.dk/), held in Copenhagen (Denmark) from 26-28 August 2013 at the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters (H.C. Andersens Boulevard 35, Copenhagen, Denmark). The workshop was organised by the [Centre for Ocean Life](http://www.oceanlifecentre.dk/). I was invited to give an overview of trait based approaches in plant ecology. <!-- more -->
