I attended the recent [useR 2016](http://user2016.org/) conference at Stanford, USA, where I presented a talk on the technologies for building and distributing [the Biomass And Allometry Database](https://github.com/dfalster/baad). All talks were [recorded](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/The-challenge-of-combining-176-x-otherpeoplesdata-to-create-the-Biomass-And-Allometry-Database-BAAD) (see also below) and slides are available [here](http://danielfalster.com/talks/Falster-2016-Challenge_building_BAAD-userR.pdf).  

The talk compliments a [post on the ropensci blog](https://ropensci.org/blog/2015/06/03/baad/) and our 2015 [data paper](http://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E096/128/)
in *Ecology*.

Aside from the conference, a highlight of the trip for me was doing a bit of Ecotourism with Dr Will Cornwell in redwood forests and Californian chaparral.
